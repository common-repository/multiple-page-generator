Multiple Page Generator can generate multiple pages with title, content, meta data, etc. with just few clicks.

== Description == 

Multiple Page Generator is the latest plugin designed to generate multiple pages while ensuring that duplicate content is eliminated. Keywords are assigned to pre-set variables which are then replaced during the page generation process. For example, zip, state, city, phone, images, etc).

The Multiple Page Generator allows keywords to be created and displayed for the users. In turn, this allows SEO experts to select the keywords based on the content being created. Once the page template has been created multiple pages are generated based on the keywords.

Features

- Meta Tags Automatically Populated - A single click will create the page. This includes the page name, page title, SEO title, Meta description, and its content.

- CSS Styling - Multiple Page Generator also has the capability to add custom CSS styling to your text, images, whole container and title.

- Upload Keywords - The plugin also provides a secondary entry/insertion, where you can upload an Excel File (.xlsx) with all your keywords and its values. This, in turn, will automatically populate the database with your keywords.
